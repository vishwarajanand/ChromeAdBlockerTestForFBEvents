# Chrome Ad Blocker Test For FB Events

This repository contains a page hosted here: [https://vishwarajanand.github.io/ChromeAdBlockerTestForFBEvents/](https://vishwarajanand.github.io/ChromeAdBlockerTestForFBEvents/). 

The page tests via JS whether the browser allows FB events for user tracking or not. Usually Ad Blockers block FB Events and cause issues in debugging FB events.

# Extending

Add your own callsites in variable `testURLs` to test whether browsers allow them or not.
